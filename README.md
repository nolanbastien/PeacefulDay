# Peaceful Day
Mobile app developed during PolyHacks Hackatown 2022

In under 2 days, with no previous experience in mobile app development, we were able to create an android app which allowed users to create routines with practices of mindfulness.

Here is the presentation video with a demo we had to submit at the end of the hackathon.
